Project Overview: Data-Analysis-Report-for-Expedia.pdf

This file contains my project which analyzed the sample data provided by Expedia. data that are used for analyzing in this project are a random sample consisted of 1000 searches made by consumers who made at least one click on the Expedia website during a period from 2021-06-01 to 2021-07-31.

The three research questions my project focused on are:
    “Is the proportion of listing properties that can be cancelled freely in all searches 50%?”
    “Is the proportion of searches that took children the same in June and in July?”
    “Given a search including under age, what is the plausible range of star rating on average for the hotel that is suitable for this search?” (Under age is defined as being either a child or infant)
  
By focusing these topics, we can determine whether consumers are more inclined to properties providing free-cancellation policy. We can know whether the the pattern of traveling is affected by different schedule for schools. We can also see what range of star rating on average would parents choose if they bring their kids on trips.

The sample provided has a great importance for Expedia because the sampling period is in summer and has the peak amount of tourists. We can give suggestions to Expedia on how to improve their work based on the given data and our analysis.
